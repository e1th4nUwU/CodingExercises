Coding Exercises I've done to practise programming logic =)

## Important note :exclamation:
Most of this work was done when I was much younger, so it isn't that well documented and some of the practises aren't that great compared to what I know today, however, it was one of the things that made me start studying about computers and programming in general, so I decided to keep it. =)

## Why are they important :question:
The best way to learn something is by actually doing it. Practicing programming logic regularly it's very important not only to prevent us from forgetting how computers think, but also to keep our brain active and challenging it to solve both logical and mathematical problems. :brain::bulb:

## Why would you document them :question:
There are a lot of reasons why I decided to document this hobby inside a repository, the main ones are:
- It allows me to access it from anywhere (as long as there is an internet connection of course). :signal_strength:
- Having my work on the cloud prevents me from losing it in case my computer breaks, gets stolen or simply gets corrupted. :skull:
- I am able to share it with other people like you who might find it useful someday. :handshake:
- In case I apply to a job somewhere, I am able to show them my way of solving problems using this repository. :necktie:
- By doing this, I am also familiarising myself with both Git and GitHub, which are both extremely important tools to learn if I want to make a career of this one day. :keyboard:
